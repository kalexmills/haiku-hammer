### Roadmap

 - Check haiku via DMs to the bot (give a friendly reason why something is not a Haiku).
 - sqlite3 and admin channel config 

#### Language edge cases:
 - Single letter words
 - Handle elongated common single-syllable exclamations like 'ohhhh', 'ummm', and 'ahhhh'.
 - Search for and include more slang terms like 'bot'.
