### Roadmap
 - Admin-only channel configuration.
 - Detect unique haiku via a hash.
 - Vote for Haiku of the week / month / year.
 - Add emoji to Haiku based on the words found in the haiku

#### Language edge cases:
 - Single letter words
 - Handle elongated common single-syllable exclamations like 'ohhhh', 'ummm', and 'ahhhh'.
 - Search for and include more slang terms like 'bot'.
   - Use a corpus of tweets or something with enough internet slang and find words not in the current dictionary.
